E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: \"In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).\" Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well.  "

His performance was amazing and so when he was done we went out to get his autograph. He was so sweet he signed the date and my name as well and was gracious enough to do it on my Hanson tour book becuase I had not been able to get anything of his yet. Anyway he is a great person and his music is absolutely awsome. I highly recomend this cd!!!!!Melinda                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Many a night I sat and nursed a beer, and laughed and cried to their music. He writes some of his songs, but when he does Lightfoot or Guy Clark, or whoever, I almost always like his version better. I wore out the album, and the first CD, and still listen to him almost every day. And he still makes me laugh and cry. He's gone now, but he lives on in mellow tones, and silly giggles. Sometimes I can even hear myself in the background singing along, or laughing. He's been my favorite music since the first time I heard him 30 some years ago. You won't be sorry.   \n",

It's much nicer looking than the 'plastic' ones you see. What I don't like about this chair is the day-to-day functionality of it. It does not adjust, at all. As the baby gets older, I want a chair that tilts, adjusts, etc-- and this does not do that. Also, it is very heavy and hard to move; it does not slide on the floor well at all. The seatbelt is clumsy and a pain to put through the fabric cover when you take the cover on or off for cleaning. After being used multiple times, the velcro that fastens the fabric cover down will no longer stick so every time you lift your child out of the highchair, the cover comes with them. I found myself very frustrated with this chair.I would not recommend this chair to anyone. I do think it's pretty though if you are going strictly by looks!</td>\n",

The shelf under the seat is a great place to store bibs.The downside of the Eddie Bauer high chair is that its difficult to clean. I have toddler twins, I don't have a lot of time to spend cleaning their high chairs with a toothbrush! The slats on the side of the seat are close together and food gets slopped in between them at every meal. If you don't throughly clean this up after each meal, it dries and is difficult to get clean.Another downside is my kids never really fit well into these highchairs. They were always too short for the tray, and the tray was always too far away as opposed to other highchairs. This helped create even more food mess!</td>\n",

       "0        I hope a lot of people hear this cd. We need more strong and positive vibes like this. Great vocals, fresh tunes, cross-cultural happiness. Her blues is from the gut. The pop sounds are catchy and mature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1        I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "2        The music of Yasunori Misuda is without question my close second below the great Nobuo Uematsu.Chrono Cross OST is a wonderful creation filled with rich orchestra and synthesized sounds. While ambiance is one of the music's major factors, yet at times it's very uplifting and vigorous. Some of my favourite tracks include; \"Scars Left by Time, The Girl who Stole the Stars, and Another World\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3        Probably the greatest soundtrack in history! Usually it's better to have played the game first but this is so enjoyable anyway! I worked so hard getting this soundtrack and after spending [money] to get it it was really worth every penny!! Get this OST! it's amazing! The first few tracks will have you dancing around with delight (especially Scars Left by Time)!!

       "2999994  The high chair looks great when it first comes out of the box but it is all down hill after that. It is impossible to keep clean. The finish is flaking off, after less than 6 months of use. It is not worth the struggle to keep up. If you already have it, call the customer service number and order a second chair pad. It is only $12 and does help to be able to switch out when one is in the wash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2999995  I have used this highchair for 2 kids now and finally decided to sell it because I did not like it. It's a beautiful chair and looks great in the kitchen. It's much nicer looking than the 'plastic' ones you see. What I don't like about this chair is the day-to-day functionality of it. It does not adjust, at all. As the baby gets older, I want a chair that tilts, adjusts, etc-- and this does not do that. Also, it is very heavy and hard to move; it does not slide on the floor well at all. The seatbelt is clumsy and a pain to put through the fabric cover when you take the cover on or off for cleaning. After being used multiple times, the velcro that fastens the fabric cover down will no longer stick so every time you lift your child out of the highchair, the cover comes with them. I found myself very frustrated with this chair.I would not recommend this chair to anyone. I do think it's pretty though if you are going strictly by looks!   \n",
       "2999996  We have a small house, and really wanted two of these high chairs for our twins. Space-wize, they are great; they have a small footprint and look nice along side the rest of our furniture.The 2nd tray and the slide-out cup holders are a great addition to this high chair. The shelf under the seat is a great place to store bibs.The downside of the Eddie Bauer high chair is that its difficult to clean. I have toddler twins, I don't have a lot of time to spend cleaning their high chairs with a toothbrush! The slats on the side of the seat are close together and food gets slopped in between them at every meal. If you don't throughly clean this up after each meal, it dries and is difficult to get clean.Another downside is my kids never really fit well into these highchairs. They were always too short for the tray, and the tray was always too far away as opposed to other highchairs. This helped create even more food mess!                    \n",
       "2999997  I agree with everyone else who says this chair is hard to clean. I bought the lighter colored wood chair, which really makes the grime build up noticeable, especially on the foot rest. We clean the high chair all the time, but the wood almost has an absorbency about it and there's just so much you're able to get clean. And I'm not sure why some areas that have been cleaned have a sticky feeling to them except that maybe it's a reaction of the wood to the chemicals in disinfectant wipes.

The 'myth' has been dealt with far better by people who really seem to understand it (it's too deep I think for Brooker's milieu), and the pop culture is presented without any kind of analysis or penetration.I think you are better off with Leach's 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild' or Sigler's 'Alternative Alices'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
